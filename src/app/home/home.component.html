<h2 class="homeHeader">Our Story</h2>
<p>“The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others” – Mahatma Gandhi</p>
<br>
<p>Inspired by this ethos, we engage towards achieving an equitable and sustainable. The irreversible effects of climate change
     pose a significant threat to all of us due to our uncontrolled exploitation and
     human-induced destruction of natural resources.

    Environmental factors are responsible for 24% of all deaths worldwide, while 28% of mortality
    for children under the age of five. This is extremely alarming and immediate action is required to
    restore the ecosystem for human wellbeing. We are working to achieve an equitable and
    sustainable society, targeting every sphere of sustainability: environmental, social and economic.
    However, there is a common misconception that economic progress and environmental
    protection are mutually exclusive. In truth, we must address all three aspects of sustainability at
    the same time. To achieve this, we are embracing education, empowerment, and equality as long-
    term sustainability strategies in order to make our &quot;ONLY HOME&quot; more resilient and healthier.
